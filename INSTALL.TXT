What is CoMeet?

It is a messaging system designed for huge networks 
where is required special attention to the bandwidth 
load, because it is low/scarce or because the access 
is billed for every data transmission (i.e. GSM).

Installation Manual

- Dependencies

  * Java 6.0 (SDK)
  * Ant
  * Mail Server SMTP (i.e. Postfix)
  * Pop Server (i.e. Qpopper)
  * PostgreSQL Server

- Compilation 

  1. Get into the directory where the CoMeet source
     code is located
  2. Run the command: 
     % ./build.sh compile
  3. Get into the directory called "dist", located in
     the source code root. There you will find three
     directories:
     - Cliente: contains the compressed file with the
       binaries for the IM client. 
     - Administrador: contains the compressed file with
       the binaries of the program for user management.
     - Servidor: contains the compressed file with the
       binaries of the IM server.

- Installation

  * CoMeet Server

    1. Create a user in the PostgreSQL server and
       and call it "comeetadmin"
       % creatuser comeetadmin

    2. Create a data base in the PostgreSQL server
       and call it "comeet"
       % createdb -U comeetadmin comeet

    3. Create a mail user in your SMTP server with 
       the name "comeet" and set it a password 

    4. Copy the compressed file comeetserver.tar.gz in 
       the directory where you want to make the 
       installation
       i.e.: /usr/local

    5. Uncompress the file. The directory called "comeet"
       will be created:
       % tar xvfz comeetserver.tar.gz

    6. Get into the directory "comeet/db" and load the  
       script called "comeet_dump.sql" into the data base
       you created in the step 2
       % psql -U comeetadmin comeet < comeet_dump.sql 

    7. Get into the directory "comeet/conf" and edit the
       file server.conf and set the variables according
       your network settings, including, data base, 
       PostgreSQL Server address, SMTP Server address,
       POP user, passwords, etc. 

       Note: The section about Oracle only is required
       if you wants to sync IM data with records saved in 
       an Oracle data.

    8. Start up the IM server, running the command:
       % /usr/local/comeet/bin/comeet.sh

       Note: By default, it uses port 9119

  * CoMeet Admin

    1. Once you get your CoMeet server available
       to allow connections, copy the compressed
       file of the admin interface into the 
       computer from you want to make users
       management.

       comeetadmin.zip : For Windows
       comeetadmin.tar.gz : For Linux

    2. Uncompress the compressed file taking special
       care of your OS: 

       - For Linux
         a) Create the directory where your want to install
            binary files
            % mkdir /usr/local/comeetadmin
         b) Move the compressed file into the directory you 
            created
            % mv comeetadmin.tar.gz /usr/local/comeetadmin
         c) Uncompress the file 
            % tar xvfz comeetadmin.tar.gz

       - For Windows
         a) Create the directory "comeetadmin" into the C: drive 
         b) Use winzip or any kind of app for file uncompression and
            extract the files into the carpet you created in a)

    3. Get into the directory "comeetadmin" and run the binary
       for your OS:
       In Linux: comeetadminUnix.sh 
       Note: Befor your run the script, edit it and 
       add as the first instruction:
       cd /usr/local/comeetadmin

       In Windows: comeetadmin.exe 

    Note: "admin" is the default admin user, and the password 
          is "12345"

  * CoMeet Client

    1. Once you got the CoMeet server available
       to allow connections, copy the compressed file of the client
       in every computer you want to use  
       comeetclient.zip : For Windows
       comeetclient.tar.gz : For Linux
   
    2. Uncompress the installer taking care of your OS:

       - For Linux
         a) Create the directory where you want to install
            the binaries
            % mkdir /usr/local/comeetclient
         b) Move the compressed file into the directory 
            % mv comeetclient.tar.gz /usr/local/comeetclient
         c) Uncompress the file 
            % tar xvfz comeetclient.tar.gz

       - For Windows
         a) Create the directory "comeet" into the C: drive 
         b) Use Winzip or any kind of app for file uncompression 
            and extract the binaries into the directory you
            created in a)

    3. Edit the file "conf/comeet.conf" and set the address 
       or the name of the IM server in the field "host"

    4. Get into the directory "comeet" and run the binary or
       script for your OS:
       In Linux: comeetclient.sh  
       Note: Before you run the script, edit it and add a new
       line in the beginning with the command:
       cd /usr/local/comeetclient

       In Windows: comeetclient.exe
